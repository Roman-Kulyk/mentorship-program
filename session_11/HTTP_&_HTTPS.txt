HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for
transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for
communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for
other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client
opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives
a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep
any data (state) between two requests.

The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions
tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called
servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients and servers
communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and
server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server
programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not
share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server.
Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await
incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the
client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.
