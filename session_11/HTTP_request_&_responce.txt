HTTP request methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be
performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request
 methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a
different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: 
e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

1. The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. 
Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

2. The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, 
but without the response body.

3. The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a
change in state or side effects on the server.

4. The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource
with the request payload.

5. The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

6. The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target
resource.

7. The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
 
8. The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the
target resource.

9. The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

HTTP response status codes

1. Informational responses (100 – 199)
2. Successful responses (200 – 299)
3. Redirection messages (300 – 399)
4. Client error responses (400 – 499)
5. Server error responses (500 – 599)
