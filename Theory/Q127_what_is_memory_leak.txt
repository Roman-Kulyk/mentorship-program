Memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program
incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory which is no longer
needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored
in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. A memory leak has symptoms
similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a
programmer with access to the program's code.

Consequences:
A memory leak reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of
available memory. A memory leak can cause an incease in memory usage, performance
run-time and can negatively impact the user experience.

Much more serious leaks include those:
-where a program runs for a long time and consumes added memory over time, such
as background tasks on servers, and especially in embedded systems which may be
left running for many years.
-where new memory is allocated frequently for one-time tasks, such as when
rendering the frames of a computer game or animated video.
-where a program can request memory, such as shared memory, that is not released,
even when program terminates.
- where memory is very limited, such as in an embedded system or portable device,
or where the program requires a very large amount of memory to begin with, leaving
little margin for leaks.
-where a leak ocurs within the operating system or memory manager
-when a system device driver causes a leak
-running on an operating system that does not automatically release memory on
program termination.
