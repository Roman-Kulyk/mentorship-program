Public methods are those that can be accessed from anywhere 
within or outside the class. They play a significant role in
interacting with the class's attributes and functionality.
These method allow external code to interact with the class's
functionalities directly.

Private methods in a Python's class are those that can only
be accessed from inside the class. They are indicated by
prefixing the method name with double underscore __. These
methods are used for internal class operations, enhancing
encapsulation and preventing accidental misuse or overriding.

Protected methods are those that can only be accessed from
incide the class and its subclasses. Protected methods are
indicated by prefixing the method name with a single
underscore _. Protected methods provide a way to allow
subclasses to access certain methods while still preventing
direct access from external code.
