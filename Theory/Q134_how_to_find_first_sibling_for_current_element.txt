To select the immediate next sibling element, you can use the folloving XPath
syntax:

xpath_expression/following-sibling::tagName[1]

The [1] ensures that only the immediate next sibling is selected.

You can add conditions to your XPath expression to filter the sibling elements
based on their attributes, text, or other characteristics.

xpath_expression/following-sibling::tagName[@attribute = 'value']
