To get the next or following sibling element of a given element in Selenium Python, call the find_element() 
method on the given element and pass By.XPATH for by parameter, and 'following-sibling::*[1] for the value 
parameter in the function call.
If myelement is the WebElement object for which we would like to find the next sibling element, the code 
snippet for find_element() method is:
myelement.find_element(By.XPATH, "following-sibling::*[1]")
