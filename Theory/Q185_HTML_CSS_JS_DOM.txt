HTML(Hyper Test Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the WEB.
It defines the maning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides
HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
or functionality/behaviour(JavaScript).

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
presentation of a document written in HTMl or XML(incrluding XML dialects such
SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on
screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known
as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
use it. JavaScript is prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-treaded,
dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, iperative, and declarative 
styles.

The DOM (Document Object MOdel) is an API that represents and interacts with
any HTML or XML-based markup language document. The DOM is a document model
loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, or DOM tree,
where each node represents part of the document.
The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the WEB because it allows codr running
in abrowser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be
created, moved, and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered
on the occurrence of a given event.
