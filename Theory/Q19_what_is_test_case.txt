A TEST CASE is a set of actions performed on a system to determine if it
satisfies software requirements and functions correctly. The purpose of a test
case is to determine if different features within- a system are performing as
expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards,
guidelines and customer requirements. The process of writing a test case can
also help reveal errors or defectes within the system.

A test case document includes test steps, test data, preconditions and postcondi
tions to verify requirements.
The components of a test case include:
- test name;
- test ID;
- Objective(description);
- References;
- Prerequisites;
- Test setup;
- Test steps;
- Expected results;
- Actual results.
