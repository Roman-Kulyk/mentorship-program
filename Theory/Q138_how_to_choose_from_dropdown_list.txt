How to Select Option in Dropdown using Selenium python
The Select class in Selenium id used to handle dropdown. Selenium WebDriver
provides a class named 'Select'. You need to import the Select class from it.

There are multiple methods to select/deselect dropdowns in Selenium python. 
They are:

select_by_index(int index)/deselect_by_index(int index)
Index value are started from 0 and continue with an increment of +1. It means
if there are five dropdown values then they will be 0,1,2,3, and 4.

select_by_value(String text)/deselect_by_value(String text)
You have to pass a text as a parameter to select_by_value.  Then it will match
the value attribute text so that the user can click the dropdown value for which
it becomes matched.

select_by_visible_text(String text)/deselect_by_visible_text(String text)
When you pass a text as a parameter to select_by_visible_text, it will match
with the visible text attribute so that you can click the dropdown value for
which it becomes matched.
