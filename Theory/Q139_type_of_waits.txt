Implicit Waits
An implicit wait tells WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time
when trying to find any element (or elements) not immediately available. the
default setting is 0. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the
WebDriver object.

Explicit Waits
An explicit wait is a code you define to wait for a certain condition to occur
before proceeding further in the code. The extreme case of this is time.sleep(),
which sets the condition to an exact time period to wait. There are some
convenience methods provided that help you write code that will wait only as
long  as required. Explicit waits are achieved by using WebDriverWait class in
combination with expected_conditions.

Some of the Expected Conditions:
- title_is
- title_contains
- presence_of_element_located
- visibility_of_element_located
- visibility_of
- presence_of_all_elements_located
- element_located_to_be_selected
- element_selection_state_to_be
- element_located_selection_state_to_be
- alert_is_present

Fluent Waits
Fluent Wait is one of the mechanisms available at Selenium WebDriver that
permits to set the maximal time for a condition to be accomplished and the
frequency of their attempts to check the condition. Fluent Wait offers more
flexibility since programmers can change the wait conditions according to the
complications and situations during the runtime.
