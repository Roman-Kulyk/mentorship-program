A Python testing framework is a set of tools, conventions, and libraries
designed to support the automation of tests for software applications. Automation
testing involves the use of automated scripts and tools to execute test cases,
compare actual results, and generate test reports without manual intervention.
It guarantees that the software functions correctly and meets defined standards.
It also ensures software reliability, prevents bugs and enhances overall code
quality.

Pytest
Is an open-source and one of the widely used Python testing framework. It is an 
alternative to the built-in PyUnit frameworkd and offers a more concise, readable,
and user-friendly syntax for writing test that PyUnit.
It is designed to make testing simple and enjoyable while providing a wide range
of features and extensions to meet various testing needs. It has a rich pugin
architecture with 800+ external plugins and a thriving community.

Benefits:
- pytest offers a straighforward syntas and robust features that lead to shorter,
more readable test code, simplifying comprehension and upkeep.
- it has a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and extensions that can be easily
integrated to extend its functionality and support additional testing needs.

Limitations:
pytest provides a user-friendly way to create test cases, but it might not
seamlessly integrate with other Python testing frameworks. Due to Pytest's 
distinctive approach swithching to a different testing framework requires
rewriting the entire codebase.

PyUnit
Is  a built-in testing framework in Python. It is a versatile and powerful
module designed for unit testing in Python. It empowers developers to write
focused and independent tests and allows the m to verify specific parts of 
their code with precision. It supports fixtures, test cases, test suites, and a
specialized test runner for automation testing.

Benefits
- is a part of the Python standard library, requiring no extra installations
and ensuring accessibility for all Python developers.
- it provides a comprehensive set of tools for testing that allow developers to
test various aspects of their code and offer flexibility in test writing and
execution.
- it generates detailed test reports, providing developers with valuable insights
into the test results and helping them identify and resolve issues quickly.
- it can be easily integrated into CI and CD pipelines.

Limitations
- it may not be as flexible and customizable as some third-party testing
frameworks.
- the use of setup and teardown methods in test fixtures can introduce overhead
an complexity, especially whe dealing with extensive test suites.

Robot
Is an open-source automation testing framework with a primary focus on Selenium
test automation, RPA(Robot Process Automation), and ATDD(Acceptance Test Driven 
Development). Its user-friendly syntax employs human-readable keywords, and it
seamlessly operates across multiple operating systems.

Benefits
- no programming knowledge is necessary to write test cases using the Robot
framework.
- it simplifies automation testing with its keyword-driven approach and creates
readable test cases for testers.
- it supports various operating systems and application types, including web and
mobile apps  that encure broad compatibility.
- its rich ecosystem and extensive library support make it highly extensible and
easily integrable with third-party tools.

Limitations
- you can easily generat HTML reports with Robot framework but achieving highly
customized reports will be a difficult task.
