TEST DESIGN is a process that defines how testing has to be done. It involves
the process of identifying the testing techniques, test scenarios, test cases,
test data, and expected test results. Also, testers need to be specific about
the test cases they create, such as providing specific inputs, steps, and test
data for each test case.

Test design includes the following major activities:
- designing and prioritizing test cases and sets of test cases;
- identifying necessary tes data to support tes conditions and tes cases;
- designing the test environment and identifying any required infrastructure
and tools;
- capturing bi-directional traceability between the test basis, test conditions,
and test cases.
