The short answer is that a Python virtual environment is a folder structure
that gives you everything you need to run a lightweight yet isolated Python
environment.

Create It
PS> python -m venv venv

Activate It
PS> venv\Scripts\activate

Install Packages Into It
(venv) PS> python -m pip install <package-name>

Deactivate It
(venv) PS> deactivate

Why Do You Need Virtual Environments?
The short answer is that Python isn’t great at dependency management.
If you’re not specific, then pip will place all the external packages that
you install in a folder called site-packages/ in your base Python installation.

Decide Where to Create Your Environment Folders
A Python virtual environment is just a folder structure. You can place it 
anywhere on your system. However, a consistent structure can help, and there
are two prominent opinions on where to create your virtual environment 
folders:

1. Inside each individual project folder
2. In a single location, for example in a subfolder of your home directory
