Factory Design Pattern is one of the most used creational patterns as it
provides one of the best ways to create  an object. The term factory here means
that there should be a class with a factory method which deals with all the
creational stuff. 

In this pattern, there is a superclass with multiple subclasses and based on the
user input at test class level, it returns one of the subclasses. In other
words, it is used to create an object from one of the possible classes that
extends a common parent class/ implements an interface. The instantiation logic
would be the responsibility of the class that is extending the parent class
thereby it hides the complex code at test level. As a user, we just need to
create an object of this class and use it in the test class to call the
appropriate method holding the business logic.
