Process and threads are the basic components in OS. Process is a program under
execution whereas a thread is part of process. Threads allowa a program to
perform multiple task simultaniously, like downloading a file while you browse
a website or running animations while processing user input. A process can
consist of multiple threads.

What is Process?
Processes are basically the programs that are dispatched from the ready state
and are scheduled in the CPU for execution. A process can create other Processes
which are known as Child Processes. The process takes more time to terminate,
and  it is isolated means it does not share the memory with any other process.
The process can have the following states new, ready, running, waiting,
terminated and suspended.

What is Thread?
Threads are often called "lightweight process" because they share some features
of processes but are smaller and faster. Each thread is always part of one
specific process. A thread- has three states: Running, Ready and Blocked.
A thread  takes less time to terminate as compared to the process but unlike the 
process, threads do not isolate.
