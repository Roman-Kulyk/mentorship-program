//*[text()='Button']

Here you can add tagName instead of * as well

//*[@id = 'exp-0']

Here tagName will get searched from the top of DOM. Now you can replace it 
tagName with * so that it will check for any tag in the DOM hierarchy with
given attribute and attribute value.

//div[@ *  = 'col-span-1']
Now you can replace it tagName with * so that it will check for div tag in 
the DOM hierarchy with any attribute and given attribute value.
