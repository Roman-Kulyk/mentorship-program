What is == Operator?
To  compare objects based on their values, Python's equality operator(==) are
employeed. It calls the left object's __eq__() class method, which specifies
the criteria for determining equality. However, these constraints are typically
written so that the equality operator == returns True if two objects, have the 
same value, and returns False if both have different value.

What is the 'is' Operator?
Python identify operator (is, is not) are used to compare objects based on their
identify. When the variables on either side of an operator point at the exact
same object, the 'is' operator's evaluation is true. Otherwise, it would provide
us with a false assessment.
