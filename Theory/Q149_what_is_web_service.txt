A web service is a software system with open protocols that has a unique URL address and maintains 
communication between two applications via the internet. Being platform and technology independent, 
a web service acts as a mediator that can connect all types of applications across the web regardless 
of the programming language they are written in. For instance, Java applications can be connected to 
.NET applications. Such compatibility is possible due to open standards of web services, while the 
communication happens via the data exchange formats XML/JSON and the protocols of web communication 
HTTP/HTTPS.
There are two main components of such communication: client (a service consumer) and server 
(a service provider). Usually, a client requests the server to get or save the data. Letâ€™s say you 
want to find some place on Google Maps from your mobile phone. In this case, the application on your 
mobile device is a client while Google Maps service is a server that returns the required data 
(specific location) upon your request.

Companies actively use web services for common tasks, for instance, when integrating payments to 
their platforms or while registering users on a new website via Facebook or Google credentials. 
Asking Siri or Alexa the weather forecast and using Google Maps are other examples of web services 
in a day-to-day routine.
