Response
The Response interface of the FetchAPI represents the response to a request.

You can create a new Response object using the Response() constructor, but You
are more likely to encounter a Response object being returned as the results of
another API operation.

Type of responses:
- constructor:Response()
- instance properties:body
                      bodyUsed
                      headers
                      ok
                      redirected
                      status
                      statusText
                      Typeurl
- static methods:error()
                 json()
                 redirect()
- instance methods:arrayBuffer()
                   blob()
                   bytes()
                   clone()
                   formData()
                   json()
                   text()
