CRUD operations are the cornerstone of application functionality, touching
every aspect of how apps store, retrieve, and manage date. 

CREATE: This is about adding new entries to your database. But it's also
applicable to other types of persistent storage, such as files or networked
services. When you perform a create operation, you're initiating a journey
for a new piece of data within your system.

READ: Through reading, you retrieve or view existing database entries. This
operation is as basic as checking your email or reloading a website. Every 
piece of inforamtion you get has been received from a database, thanks to 
rease operation.

UPDATE: Updating allows you to modify the details of data already in the
database. For example, when you update a profile picture or edit a chat message.
Each time, there's an update operation at work, ensuring your new data is stored
in the database.

DELETE: Deleting removes existing entries from the database. Whether you're
closing an account or removing a post, delete operations ensure that unwanted
or unnecessary data can be properlly discarded.
