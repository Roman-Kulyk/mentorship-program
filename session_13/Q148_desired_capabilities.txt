Desired Capabilities are a set of key-value pairs encoded as a JSON object.
It helps QAs define basic test requirements such as operating systems, browser
combinations, browser versions, etc. within Selenium test scripts to perform
automated cross browser testing of web application.

The DesiredCapabilitiesClass has multiple methods that let QAs specify the
required properties regarding the desired test environments.

Why do QAs need DesiredCapabilities?
Each specific test case needs to be executed in a different environment
(browser, mobile, or an operating system) as per the market trends. For
example, a QA might need to test a Web-application on two different browsers
(Chrome, Safari) installed on mobile devices running on different operating
systems(Android, iOS).
