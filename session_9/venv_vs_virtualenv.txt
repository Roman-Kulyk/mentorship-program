Virtual environments are a self-contained directory tree that contais a Python
installation for particular version of Python, plus a number of additional
packages. Different applications can use different virtual environments.

venv - is the module used toe create and manage virtual environments.
venv usually install the most recent version of Python that you have available.
To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place
it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:

python -m tutorial-env

This will create the tutorial-env directory if it doesn't exist, and also create
directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter and various
supporting files.

Once you've created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
On Windows, run:
tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
On Unix, run:
source tutorial-env/bin/activate

Activating the virtual environment will change your shell's prompt to show what
virtual environment you're using.

To deactivate a virtual environment, type in terminal:

deactivate


Traditionally virtualenv has been the library used to create virtual environments
for python. However, starting python3.3, module venv has been added to python
standard library and can be used as drop-in replacement for virtualenv. if older
version of python is being used, then virtualenv is the way to go.
Appart from some small differences, venv and virtualenv work similarly.
